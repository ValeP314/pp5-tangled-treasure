### Validator Testing

* HTML
  * No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator:
    * [Home Page](./static/images/html_test.png)

* CSS
  * No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator]()
    * [Home Page](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?lang=it&profile=css3svg&uri=https%3A%2F%2Ffuture-home.herokuapp.com%2F&usermedium=all&vextwarning=&warning=1)

* Python
  * I used [Python linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/), and one error was returned on the settings.py file:
    * Line 128 is too long (87 characters over 79 allowed), but unfortunately it is not possible to modify it.
    [Settings.py](./static/images/Settings.py.png)

  * The remaining Python files did not show any errors:
    * [Asgi.py](./static/images/asgy_py.png)
    * [Urls.py](./static/images/urls_py.png)
    * [Wsgi.py](./static/images/wsgi_py.png)

    * [Urls.py](./static/images/urls_app_py.png)
    * [Views.py](./static/images/views_py.png)

* Accessibility
  * Performance, accessibility and best practices were assessed through Lighthouse in devtools and passed the testing with good scores.
    ![Lighthouse](./static/images/lighthouse.png)
  * The Performance score might be improved converting the .png files in .webp files, in order to compress the images and facilitate the upload when the page is loaded. For lack of time, I did not convert them, but it is certainly an improvement that can be made.

### Manual Testing

* Navigation Bar:
  *  
* Home Page:
  *  
* Footer:
  * When clicked, the "Facebook" icon opens a new tab and redirects to www.facebook.com.
  * When clicked, the "Twitter" icon opens a new tab and redirects to www.twitter.com.
  * When clicked, the "YouTube" icon opens a new tab and redirects to www.youtube.com.
  * When clicked, the "Instagram" icon opens a new tab and redirects to www.instagram.com.
* List of items:
  * The list of items is fully responsive and displays 4 items on larger screens, 3 on medium screens, 2 on small screens and 1 on mobile devices. The feature has been tested for numerous screen sizes and works well.
* Search box:
  * The search functionality was tested searching for words included in the title (such as bag, toy, etc.) and included in the descriptions (such as cotton, wool, etc.).
  * The search functionality was tested for categories of items, making sure that they would all work.
  * Sorting functionality was tested for ascending and descending price, just modifying the URL, and they both worked.
  * Sorting by category was implemented and tested for ascending and descending alphabetical order, modifying the URL, and they both worked fine.
  * The number of items called at the beginning of the page list was tested at every search and sorting instance, and worked evry time.
  * The "Sort by" box was tested for each and every option, and they all worked fine.
  * The "Back to the top" button was afded to the list of items page, in oder to go back to the top of the page easily, without having to scroll through hundreds of items. It was tested on numerous searches and sorting instances, and it always worked well.
* Shopping bag:
  * Functionality to add/remove items was added and tested multiple times successfully.
  * When adding an item, a success message pops up, to show that the toasts work fine.
  * When removing an item, a success message pops up, to show that the toasts work fine.
  * The toast message shows a preview of the shopping bag successfully.
  *  
* Checkout:
  * The checkout page is updated fter adding or removing items several times.
* Payments:
  * Stripe was installed and payments were checked printing "intent" to prove that the form was submitted.
  * I noticed when checking out that the email address for the confirmation email didn't come up on the checkout_success page. I checked the code and noticed that there was an interruption of the line occourred authomatically through the editor, set to authomatically format pasted content. The issue was easily rectified; another order was submitted and the email address appeared on screen.
  * The order page was accessed from the admin page, and I made changes to multiple order to make sure that the total and the delivery charges would update correctly. Every attempt was successful.
  * The checkout_page was updated to reflect order details, and it worked well. Some prices displayed in dollars instead of euros, so I substituted the dollar symbol with the euro symbol.
  * The checkout_success page was tested on different size devices and was fully responsive.
  * The spinning loading overlay was added and tested. It worked after an hard refresh, and it displayed the authentication when the card 4000002500003155 (requiring further authentication) was used.
  * The authentication was checked: if failed, the checkout bag would reload containing the information already filled except for the credit card details, with a message stating that the payment was not successful. In this way, the customer doesn't have to re-fill all fields. The authentication was then confirmed, and the payment was successful.
  * Webhooks were implemented and were checked sistematically to make sure everything was working fine.
  * Multiple purchases/payments were put through to make sure that the webhooks were all working after identified bug (then fixed, see below).
  * Confirmation emails were set up and tested on the console. The template was displayed nicely and it worked fine.
* Opening an item:
  *  
* Profile page:
  * The Profiles app was created and the webpage loaded fine when accessing from the url in early stages of development.
  * The profile page was updated to reflect the username, and it worked fine.
  * When making a purchase, it is possible to save the address, phone number and all relevant info clicking on a checkbox. The featuee has been tested deleting all info and then selecting the box, and the address was updated. 
  * The order history displays a list of all orders, showing order number, date, items and total price. There is a link in the order number that brings back to the full success page that displays all info, and works fine.
  * When attempting a new order, the info saved are displayed in the form correctly. I tested many changes, and they were all updated promptly.
* Adding items:
  * The Product Management page was created and tested using prices with more than 6 figures, or items with or without a picture. Ano_image picture was uploaded onto the media folder to account for items without a picture.
* When signing in as a regular user:

### Fixed Bugs

* The project had to be start from scratch, due to an issue with the payments. The original project was modified and reverted back to previous commits in order to fix the issue, but in the end some crucial code was lost and it was easier to start again, using the code already written up on verison 1. That repository is still accessible here [PP5 - Tangled Treasures](https://github.com/ValeP314/pp5-tangled-treasures/tree/main).
* I noticed than the container-fluid in the items.html was a bit overlayed on smaller screens and fixed the issue added a margin-top spacing to the HTML.
* The search box didn't work as the friendly name was used instead of the name of the categories. It was easy to rectify the names and fix the bug.
* I had a bug with the checkout view, as the calc_subtotal would not being found even though calculated in the checkout app. I realised the same function was working in the bag app, so I compared quickly the 2 apps and realised I hadn't loaded the "bag_tools" on the checkout.html file. The page worked well after loading that file.
* The webhooks didn't work properly when I first included them. I did some research and found a conversation on Slack about making port 8000 public. When I made the change, the webhooks started working.
* The payment_intent.succedeed webhook failed for an internal Sever Error (status 500). After comparing the code with Boutique Ado walk-through and checking on Slack, I realised I had never imported Stripe on the webhook_handler.py file.
* In the Profile page, the country field was updated in order to display as grey when not selected. The JS file didn't seem to work, so I checked and compared the code without finding the mistake. In the end, I noticed the countryfield.js file was in the static/profiles folder, instead of the static/profiles/js folder. It was iasy to migrate the file inside rhe relevant folder: when tested, the feature worked fine.  
* While testing the profile page and attempting to update address or other details, I noticed that the success message also contained the shopping bag (if not empty). To fix that I included another context variable and then updated the success message so to exclude the shopping bag on the profile page.
* 
  
### Unfixed Bugs

* Payments: there was an issue with checkout_order that I wasn't able to address in the short amout of time I had.
* Issue with Shopping bag as per shopping bag video. Implementation suggested in the video but not performed.
* Issue with quantity buttons not working properly (going to negative figures), to be reviewed.
* Issue with pictures not formatted (all different sizes).
* Issue with footer not anchored at the bottom of the page. Perhaps add a top margin?
