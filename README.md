### Validator Testing

- HTML
  * No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator:
    * [Home Page](./static/images/html_test.png)

* CSS
  * No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator]()
    * [Home Page](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?lang=it&profile=css3svg&uri=https%3A%2F%2Ffuture-home.herokuapp.com%2F&usermedium=all&vextwarning=&warning=1)

* Python
  * I used [Python linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/), and one error was returned on the settings.py file:
    * Line 128 is too long (87 characters over 79 allowed), but unfortunately it is not possible to modify it.
    [Settings.py](./static/images/Settings.py.png)

  * The remaining Python files did not show any errors:
    * [Asgi.py](./static/images/asgy_py.png)
    * [Urls.py](./static/images/urls_py.png)
    * [Wsgi.py](./static/images/wsgi_py.png)

    * [Tests.py](./static/images/tests_py.png)
    * [Urls.py](./static/images/urls_app_py.png)
    * [Views.py](./static/images/views_py.png)

* Accessibility
  * Performance, accessibility and best practices were assessed through Lighthouse in devtools and passed the testing with good scores.
    ![Lighthouse](./static/images/lighthouse.png)
  * The Performance score might be improved converting the .png files in .webp files, in order to compress the images and facilitate the upload when the page is loaded. For lack of time, I did not convert them, but it is certainly an improvement that can be made.

### Manual Testing

* Navigation Bar:
  * 
* Home Page:

* List of items:
  * The list of items is fully responsive and displays 4 items on larger screens, 3 on medium screens, 2 on small screens and 1 on mobile devices. The feature has been tested for numerous screen sizes and works well.

* Footer:
  * When clicked, the "Facebook" icon opens a new tab and redirects to www.facebook.com.

### Fixed Bugs

* The project had to be start from scratch, due to an issue with the payments. The original project was modified and reverted back to previous commits in order to fix the issue, but in the end some crucial code was lost and it was easier to start again, using the code already written up on verison 1. That repository is still accessible here [PP5 - Tangled Treasures](https://github.com/ValeP314/pp5-tangled-treasures/tree/main). 

### Unfixed Bugs

- Payments: there was an issue with checkout_order that I wasn't able to address in the short amout of time I had.
