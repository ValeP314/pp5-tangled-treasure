### Validator Testing

- HTML
  * No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator:
    * [Home Page](./static/images/html_test.png)

* CSS
  * No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator]()
    * [Home Page](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?lang=it&profile=css3svg&uri=https%3A%2F%2Ffuture-home.herokuapp.com%2F&usermedium=all&vextwarning=&warning=1)

* Python
  * I used [Python linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/), and one error was returned on the settings.py file:
    * Line 128 is too long (87 characters over 79 allowed), but unfortunately it is not possible to modify it.
    [Settings.py](./static/images/Settings.py.png)

  * The remaining Python files did not show any errors:
    * [Asgi.py](./static/images/asgy_py.png)
    * [Urls.py](./static/images/urls_py.png)
    * [Wsgi.py](./static/images/wsgi_py.png)
    * [Admin.py](./static/images/admin_py.png)
    * [Apps.py](./static/images/apps_py.png)
    * [Forms.py](./static/images/forms_py.png)
    * [Models.py](./static/images/models_py.png)
    * [Tests.py](./static/images/tests_py.png)
    * [Urls.py](./static/images/urls_app_py.png)
    * [Views.py](./static/images/views_py.png)

* Accessibility
  * Performance, accessibility and best practices were assessed through Lighthouse in devtools and passed the testing with good scores.
    ![Lighthouse](./static/images/lighthouse.png)
  * The Performance score might be improved converting the .png files in .webp files, in order to compress the images and facilitate the upload when the page is loaded. For lack of time, I did not convert them, but it is certainly an improvement that can be made.

### Manual Testing

* Navigation Bar:
  * 
* Home Page:
  * 
* Footer:
  * When clicked, the "Facebook" icon opens a new tab and redirects to www.facebook.com.
  * When clicked, the "Twitter" icon opens a new tab and redirects to www.twitter.com.
  * When clicked, the "YouTube" icon opens a new tab and redirects to www.youtube.com.
  * When clicked, the "Instagram" icon opens a new tab and redirects to www.instagram.com.
* List of items:
  * The list of items is fully responsive and displays 4 items on larger screens, 3 on medium screens, 2 on small screens and 1 on mobile devices. The feature has been tested for numerous screen sizes and works well.
* Search box:
  * The search functionality was tested searching for words included in the title (such as bag, toy, etc.) and included in the descriptions (such as cotton, wool, etc.).
  * The search functionality was tested for categories of items, making sure that they would all work.
  * Sorting functionality was tested for ascending and descending price, just modifying the URL, and they both worked.
  * Sorting by category was implemented and tested for ascending and descending alphabetical order, modifying the URL, and they both worked fine. 
  * The number of items called at the beginning of the page list was tested at every search and sorting instance, and worked evry time.
  * The "Sort by" box was tested for each and every option, and they all worked fine. 
  * The "Back to the top" button was afded to the list of items page, in oder to go back to the top of the page easily, without having to scroll through hundreds of items. It was tested on numerous searches and sorting instances, and it always worked well.
* Shopping bag:
  * Functionality to add/remove items was added and tested multiple times successfully.
  * When adding an item, a success message pops up, to show that the toasts work fine.
  * When removing an item, a success message pops up, to show that the toasts work fine.
  * The toast message shows a preview of the shopping bag successfully.
  * 
* Checkout:
  * The checkout page is updated fter adding or removing items several times.
* Payments:
  * Stripe was installed and payments were checked printing "intent" to prove that the form was submitted.
  * I noticed when checking out that the email address for the confirmation email didn't come up on the checkout_success page. I checked the code and noticed that there was an interruption of the line occourred authomatically through the editor, set to authomatically format pasted content. The issue was easily rectified; another order was submitted and the email address appeared on screen.
  * The order page was accessed from the admin page, and I made changes to multiple order to make sure that the total and the delivery charges would update correctly. Every attempt was successful.
  * The checkout_page was updated to reflect order details, and it worked well. Some prices displayed in dollars instead of euros, so I substituted the dollar symbol with the euro symbol.
  * The checkout_success page was tested on different size devices and was fully responsive.
* Opening an item:
  * 

* When signing in as a regular user:

* When signing in as an Admin:

* Security:

### Fixed Bugs

* The project had to be start from scratch, due to an issue with the payments. The original project was modified and reverted back to previous commits in order to fix the issue, but in the end some crucial code was lost and it was easier to start again, using the code already written up on verison 1. That repository is still accessible here [PP5 - Tangled Treasures](https://github.com/ValeP314/pp5-tangled-treasures/tree/main). 
* I noticed than the container-fluid in the items.html was a bit overlayed on smaller screens and fixed the issue added a margin-top spacing to the HTML.
* The search box didn't work as the friendly name was used instead of the name of the categories. It was easy to rectify the names and fix the bug.
* I had a bug with the checout view, as the calc_subtotal would not being found even though calulated in the checkout app. I realised the same function was working in the bag app, so I compared quickly the 2 apps and realised I hadn't loaded the "bag_tools" on the checkout.html file. The page worked well after loading that file.

### Unfixed Bugs

- Payments: there was an issue with checkout_order that I wasn't able to address in the short amout of time I had.
- Issue with Shopping bag as per shopping bag video. Implementation suggested in the video but not performed.
- Issue with quantity buttons not working properly (going to negative figures), to be reviewed.
